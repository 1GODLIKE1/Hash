# Hash
  Calculate md5 hash of pic___ files.jpg one by one so that the result is displayed on the screen. Place a text fragment of the command line window and a screenshot of the command line window in the report.
  
  For pic___ files.jpg prepare verification files with hashes calculated for each algorithm MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512. That is, calculate the hash for all pic___ files with one command.jpg and output redirect to a file.
  
  Place both a text fragment of the command line window and a screenshot of the command line in the report.
  The result should be four files:
  
    1. in a separate picsYY.md5 file, all hashes of all pic___ files.jpg, calculated using the MD5 algorithm
    2. in a separate picsYY.sha1 file, all hashes of all pic___ files.jpg, calculated using the SHA1 algorithm
    3. in a separate picsYY.sha256 file, all hashes of all pic___ files.jpg calculated using the SHA256 algorithm
    4. in a separate picsYY.sha512 file, all hashes of all pic___ files.jpg calculated using the SHA512 algorithm
    
  Compare the SHA1 hash of the README file in binary and text form.
  Both calculation commands
